# Travelling Intern 4
Our intern was forced to slave away and code during her holiday. After juggling between null pointer dereferences and enjoying life, her code finally compiled!

Alas, disaster struck and she lost all her source files and left behind pieces of the compiled binary during her trip! Could you backtrack her route and piece the lost binary back together again?

NOTE: Start from the web portal

ANOTHER NOTE: This challenge is only solvable after completing "travelling intern 1, 2 & 3"
