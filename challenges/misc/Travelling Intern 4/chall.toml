After juggling between null pointer dereferences and enjoying life, her code finally compiled!\n\nAlas, disaster struck and she lost all her source files and left behind pieces of the compiled binary during her trip! Could you backtrack her route and piece the lost binary back together again?\n\nNOTE: Start from the web portal\n\nANOTHER NOTE: This challenge is only solvable after completing \"travelling intern 1, 2 & 3\""
