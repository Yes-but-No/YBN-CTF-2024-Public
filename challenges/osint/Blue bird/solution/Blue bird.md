We are given the YBN twitter account, and now at first glance there doesnt seem to be a lot.
However if we take a look at the followers, we notice this selection of followers seems very weird, thus if we try to piece together this information by taking the first letter of the followers we get `QfY9lczQHdJdHV7RjMOJUW`, but if we reverse this string, we obtain `WUJOMjR7VHdJdHQzcl9YfQ`. 
Decoding the base64, we obtain the flag `YBN24{TwItt3r_X}`
