1. Checking the image metadata would show us the author of the image which is “shog0s4ka1”.
2. Running the username through sherlock would lead us to his github which has one repository with 16 edits.
3. Looking through the encoded extended description we find flags but they are all fake as suggested by the description of the repository.
4. Under Strawberry Ginger Lemonade -> 3rd update -> extended description there is a link that is encoded with base32, decrypting in dcode would lead to the link (https://www.my-diary.org/read/e/546892023).
5. Reading the diary, they should notice the weird capitalisation of letters and taking everything down, they get the username (breadmmmless).
6. Running the username through sherlock would lead them to instagram and checking the email in profile, they will find the flag format with 11NK inside. 
7. Since there is “duck song 4” in the profile, copying the link from youtube and replacing 11NK in YBN24{11NK} would give the flag “YBN24{https://youtu.be/-IV8cnGU6YM}” or "YBN24{https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-IV8cnGU6YM}".
