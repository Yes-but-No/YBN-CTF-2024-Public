Thanks for meeting up. I have been participating in many CTFs and looking for my targets that I have been trying to track down. To keep an even lower profile and not leak my identity, I have decided to cut contacts from SSM as I suspect that there might be a mole in the organisation, and I have intel that the mole is among us here right now. I also know that the mole has the wrong comms code as the rest of the SSM members (including David physically). You will need to say "Hee Hee Hee Ha" for them to respond with their comms code.

*Note if the organiser does not respond with the code word, than he/she probably not part of the challenge

Also, I have managed to capture one of my most crucial targets, Mr X. However I am unsure of his true name, and I need your help to find out what his name is. I have filtered out the possible names that Mr X can be. I also heard that the other 4 targets are still out there but very close within the vicinity.

1. Steve Johnson
2. Kevin Paul
3. Logan Svensen
4. Donald Hart
5. Dwayne Alex


Your mission, if you choose to accept is to:
1. Find who is the mole in SSM
2. Find out what Mr X's real name is
and report back to Agent David (physically) who will have more instructions for you on how to proceed.

(For storyline sake only; there is actually no mole in SSM lol)
