1. Searching on google “platforms which requires $11.44 for blue tick” would lead us to instagram.
2. Since the name is kirby and the voice actor is “makiko ohmoto”, through some trial and error the account called “kirby.kiko_” is found.
3. Looking at the post, on the bottom right corner, there is a email me and from the profile on instagram (can only be seen on phone) there is a email which participants can write to where keyword "flag" would trigger the auto response and the flag “YBN24{K1rBY5_4M4Z1NG_4DV3N7Ur35}” will be sent.
