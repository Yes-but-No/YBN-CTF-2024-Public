We're no strangers to ducks
You know the quacks and so do I (do I)
A full pond's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other duck
I just wanna tell you how I'm quacking
Gotta make you understand

Never gonna quack you up
Never gonna let you waddle down
Never gonna swim away and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

We've known each other for so long
Your wings have been aching, but you're too shy to flap 'em (flap 'em)
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
We know the pond and we're gonna swim it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna quack you up
Never gonna let you waddle down
Never gonna swim away and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Never gonna quack you up
Never gonna let you waddle down
Never gonna swim away and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
