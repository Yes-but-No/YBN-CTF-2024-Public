Use the SSTV decoder, which is Robot36 decoder on your phone, to decode the audio, thus finding the flag `YBN24{S4tellite}` (yes it might be a bit hard to squint to see the flag)

Alternative solution (for non-Android users);
- Convert the AAC file to WAV (https://cloudconvert.com/aac-to-wav)
- Use the following tool to decode the WAV file (https://github.com/colaclanth/sstv)
