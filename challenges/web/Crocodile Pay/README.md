# Crocodile Pay
*Parody of Alligator Pay from TISC

The Alligator Pay song has been stuck in Baba's head for weeks! So Baba created a competitor website so that he can forget about it. What could go wrong?

Note from Baba: I accidentally made this challenge way too long. The only relevant files are the adminLogin and adminShop code, as well as the admin API endpoints. The rest can mostly be ignored.
