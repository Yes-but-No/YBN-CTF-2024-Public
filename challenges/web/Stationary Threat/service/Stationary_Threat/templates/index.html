        <p class="text-lg w-10/12 mb-12"><b>Stationary Threat</b> was created with one goal in mind: to add a bit of chaos to the lives of students and teachers alike. We believe in pushing boundaries—specifically, the boundary between sanity and total despair. Our platform combines state-of-the-art "security" (if you can call it that) with an uncanny ability to perfectly time the deletion of critical notes. Why, you ask? Because learning is better when it's a survival game!
            <br><br>
            Our mission is simple: keep students on their toes, keep teachers guessing, and make sure nobody ever feels too comfortable. Whether it’s unintentional hilarity or the thrill of unexpected data loss, Stationary Threat is here to make sure every school day is a memorable one. After all, a little stress never hurt anyone, right? Well... maybe just a little.</p>

        <p class = "w-10/12 text-lg my-12">Stationary Threat is proudly dedicated to creating the most chaotic <b>MDM</b> (Mismanagement Disaster Module) solutions for the school of the future. Not only that, but we are deeply committed to our vision: that no student's device remains untouched by the sweet caress of random data deletion.

            Our reach spans across the entireity of North Korea, with a rapidly growing global partner network that is just as confused as we are. We’re everywhere, spreading panic and chaos, one deleted note at a time!
