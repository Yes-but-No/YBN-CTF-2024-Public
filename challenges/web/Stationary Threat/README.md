# Stationary Threat
Welcome to Stationary Threat â€“ the website no one asked for, but uses for some reason. Built for districts and schools to keep an extra close eye on students, it boasts "security" so advanced that even Baba could crack it.

Got notes saved online? Well, don't worry, Stationary Threat has your back! We thoughtfully delete all your notes just a few weeks before exams, because nothing says "student success" like a little pre-test panic.  And best of all, we'll get paid for it, and there's nothing you can do :D
