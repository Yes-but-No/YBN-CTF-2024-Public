# easy peasy lemon squeezy
I am awoken from my slumber
By the dit and the dahs that pierces through the night

My eyes snap open
My heart begins to race

I rummage through drawers, I scour through shelves,

Hoping to uncover the sound that delves
At last, a note was found, tucked away.
Revealing a tale, a hidden display...
