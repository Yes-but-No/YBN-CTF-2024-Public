# MT23209-32
Let's play a guessing game.

I'll be thinking of numbers, and you can guess them before I reveal them to you. If you guess correct 100 times straight, you will get the flag (which is my prize for you)! I will tell you whether you guess correctly, and the correct answer.

Tip: m=483. The other vars that no need adjusting we leave it as is.

Thanks!
