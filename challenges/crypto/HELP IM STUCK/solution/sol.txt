1. Looking at the patern for the numbers, we notice that the values are quite large but acsii only consists of 256 characters. Hence, we deduce that unicode (similar format but with larger values) is used (or you can write a scipt which uses chr() to convert the characters).
2. The decoded text would involve korean letters and we could use morsecode to convert the korean text to morse and from morse to english. (https://jinh.kr/morse/) 
3. From there, we are able to get the flag “YBN24{K0R34N_15_FUN}”.
